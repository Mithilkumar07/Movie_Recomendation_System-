This project is a movie recommendation system built using GTK, where users can input their preferences such as genre, language, and rating to get tailored movie suggestions. 
In addition, the application allows users to add their own reviews and ratings, making it more interactive and community-driven
Such a system helps users discover movies that match their tastes, saves time in decision-making, and encourages sharing opinions through reviews and ratings.
It can also be extended for personalized recommendations, making it useful for entertainment platforms or standalone applications
